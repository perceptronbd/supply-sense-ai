# General Development Guidelines

## Package Management - PNPM ONLY
- **ALWAYS use pnpm for package management - NEVER use npm or yarn**
- **Use `pnpm run <script-name>` for running package scripts**
- **Use `pnpm install` or `pnpm add <package>` for dependencies**
- **Use `pnpm remove <package>` for removing dependencies**
- **Check `pnpm run` to see all available scripts in the current package**

## Command Line Execution
- **ALWAYS use command line tools via terminal commands**
- **Prefer CLI commands over GUI tools or editor integrations**
- **Use `npx nx <command>` for Nx-specific commands**
- **Use `pnpm run <script>` for predefined package scripts**
- **Always check package.json scripts before running TypeScript-related commands**

## Code Quality and Best Practices
- Follow conventional commit message format for clear commit history
- Maintain code readability and follow single responsibility principle
- Use proper error handling and validation patterns
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Keep README files and documentation up to date
- Use meaningful variable and function names that self-document
- **Use defined scripts for type checking, building, and linting**
- **Prefer project-specific TypeScript configurations over global commands**

## File Editing Guidelines
- When using `insert_edit_into_file`, avoid repeating existing code
- Use line comments with `...existing code...` to represent unchanged regions
- When using `replace_string_in_file`, include 3-5 lines of context before and after
- Always check current file contents before making edits
- Ensure edits result in valid, idiomatic code

## Code Organization
- Group related functionality into logical modules
- Extract reusable utilities into separate files
- Follow consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Maintain clear separation between business logic and UI components

## Documentation
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Keep README files and documentation up to date
- Use meaningful variable and function names that self-document
